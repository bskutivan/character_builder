        <h3 class="font-black text-lg m-2 border-b border-black"> Otherwordly Patron </h3>
            <p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice.</p>

            <p>Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

            <p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power.
            <p>Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>
            <p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.</p>
            <p>Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.</p>
            <p>Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>

        <h3 class="font-black text-lg m-2 border-b border-black"> Pact Magic </h3>
            <p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.</p>

            <h4 class="m-2 font-black border-b border-black">Cantrips</h4>
                <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
                <p>You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>

            <h4 class="m-2 font-black border-b border-black">Spell Slots</h4>
                <p>Table: The Warlock shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.</p>
                <p>To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot.</p>
                <p>You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.</p>
                <p>To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>

            <h4 class="m-2 font-black border-b border-black">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
                <p>The Spells Known column of Table: The Warlock shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.</p>
                <p>A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level.</p>
                <p>When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

            <h4 class="m-2 font-black border-b border-black">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.<p>
